# Rain Prediction Analysis

## Description
This project utilizes various data mining techniques to predict rainfall using a comprehensive dataset. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter notebook which contains detailed visualizations and predictive modeling.

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

## Usage
Open the `DataMining_Project2RainDataset.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to see the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is based on 10 years of weather history from Australia, available on Kaggle. This dataset contains historical weather data necessary for analyzing and predicting rainfall patterns. 

**Source**: The dataset can be accessed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package). Note that the dataset used in this project has modifications in the column names to improve clarity and usability in analysis.
